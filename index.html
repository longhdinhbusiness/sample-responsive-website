          <p>
            With postcard-like vistas and 355 miles of hiking trails, Rocky Mountain National Park
            is one of the most popular National Parks in the country. But if you’d rather see the
            views without breaking a sweat, drive Trail Ridge Road, the highest paved road in the
            state, which is generally open May through October. To get to the park’s entrance from
            Denver, you’ll go through the town of Estes Park where along with lots of local elk
            herds, you can also check out the shops and restaurants on main street and the historic
            Stanley Hotel (aka the real life place that inspired Stephen King’s The Shining).

                This National Registered Landmark in Colorado Springs is another favorite for
                natural red rock formations, backed by the snowcapped Pikes Peak. It’s free to
                visit, with hiking trails and a loop to drive that offers plenty of scenic
                pull-offs, and be sure to look out for the famous “kissing camels” formation along
                the way. Horseback riding and rock climbing are other popular activities, along with
                a drive up the 19 mile Pikes Peak Highway, which will take you to the summit of the
                towering mountain.

                One of the most stunning mountain towns in the state (and honestly, the world),
                Telluride’s mountain backdrops greeting you upon arrival to its historic downtown
                will have you stopped in your tracks. But don’t idle for too long; board the free
                ski gondola (which runs most months of the year as the only public transportation
                service of its kind in America) to check out the sights as you bar and
                restaurant-hop between downtown Telluride and Mountain Village, where the
                world-class Telluride Ski Resort is located.

                The autumn landscapes here are simply unparalleled, though the cliché that it’s
                beautiful every time of year is, well, true. Part of the beauty of Twin Lakes (after
                you get past the striking contrast of yellow aspens against deep blue sky), is that
                you can appreciate it in a variety of ways—on foot hiking through the trees, on the
                water in a boat or balancing on a SUP board, or on a few wheels. Oh, and don’t mind
                14ers Mt. Elbert and Mt. Massive casually towering nearby; you can add conquering
                them to your to-do list after you’ve taken in the sights.
